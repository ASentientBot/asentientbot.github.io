<h1>SB2 to SWF converter</h1>
Quite a few years ago, I wrote a tool to port <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> projects to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF">SWF</a> files and standalone applications. It is now obsolete and unsupported.

<br><h2>download</h2>
For any that still want it, here is the latest build and source code.
<br><a href="/converter/Scratch%20Converter%20v3.8.zip">Converter v3.8 (Scratch v448)</a>
<br>
<br><h3>license</h3>
Scratch is licensed under the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GPL v2</a> and is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LLK/scratch-flash">open source</a>. As a derived work, my code has the same license. I was also asked to include this message: <code>Scratch is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. See http://scratch.mit.edu.</code>
<br>
<br><h3>what about the SB3 converter?</h3>
Try <a target="_blank" href="https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/">HTMLifier</a>. My Scratch 3 converter was buggy and is no longer available.
<br>
<br><h2>epilogue</h2>
Thank you to all the Scratch users, students, and teachers who made this converter surprisingly popular and sent me numerous kind emails. Keep creating awesome stuff!
